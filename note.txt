   A. Key: Content-Type

	What is Content-Type?

	The Content-Type header is an HTTP header that specifies the type of data being sent in the body of a request (or response). It tells the server how to interpret the data.

	For example:

    	If you're sending JSON data, the Content-Type would be application/json.

    	If you're sending form data, the Content-Type would be application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data.

    B. Value = application/x-www-form-urlencoded

	What is application/x-www-form-urlencoded?

	This is a specific Content-Type used when sending form data in an HTTP request. It is the default encoding type for HTML forms.
	How It Works:

   	 Data Format:

      		The data is encoded as key-value pairs.

        	Each key-value pair is separated by an & symbol.

        	Keys and values are separated by an = symbol.

        	Spaces are replaced with +, and special characters are URL-encoded.

    	Example:

    		first_name=John&last_name=Doe&username=johndoe&email=johndoe%40example.com&password=password123

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used to store and exchange data between a client and a server. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is widely used in web development, APIs, and configuration files.
